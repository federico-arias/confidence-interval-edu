            <h1>Finding the mean height of a population</h1>

            <section>
                <p>The purpose of this page is to teach you how to use a subset of a population to calculate a parameter from that same population.</p>

                <p>Calculating a parameter from a population is a task we are often confronted with. We often want to know who a country is going to vote for president or what music do 17 years old listen to, but we don't have the money, nor the time to survey a whole country or every 17 year-old in the world.</p> 
                <p>Let's take a sample of this population</p>
                <p>Things are looking good so far. Our sample's mean is prety close to the mean of the population. But, how can we be sure that this is going always to be the case? n some cases the mean of our sample could be waaay below or above from the mean of our population. </p>
                <p>Let's prove this by taking many samples from a distribution.</p>

            <div id='mean-from-sample' class='nl-box'>
                <div>
                    <p>If we take a sample of size <span class='ctrl'>20</span> from our population and we plot this histogram, our sample mean is <span class='highlight'></span>, pretty close to <span class='show'>30</span>, the population mean.</p>

                <h1>What happens when we are not so lucky?</h1>
                <p>Can we be sure that our sample mean is always going to be close to the population mean? What if we only picked low values or high values from the population? If we take, let's say, 20 samples some, due to chance, might not be so close to the population parameter (which, in this case, is the mean). As figure 2 demonstrates, If we take a lot of samples, not all the means are close to the mean of the population.</p>
                <p>We need to set an acceptable range of values in which we will consider the values close enough to the mean. This is called confidence interval. </p>

                <div>
                    <p>From our samples, <span class='show'>25</span> of a total of 25 are close to the mean.</p>

                <p>We can predict that from all the means (<span class='show'></span>), <span class='ctrl'></span>% of them are within the range <span class='show-confidence-interval'></span>.

                Normal distribution 
            -->

            <p>You can see that our prediction is fairly accurate. Our randomly generated samples are within our prediction. How did we figured out how that interval of values and that level of accurancy? Remember that if some values follow a normal distribution, we can predict how many of them are going to be within a given range. For example if we know the number of beers drinked by every US student last year, we could plot an histogram like this:</p>
            <div id='nl-block'>
                <svg id='histogram-beer'></svg>
                <div>
                    <p> In the US, <span class='ctrl-cl-beer'>% of students drinked between <span class='show-ci-beer'></span> beers.
                </div>
            </div>
            <!--
                Sampling distribution 
            -->

            <p>So, what is the group of normally distributed values from which we are going to pick an interval? The answer is: every sample mean. We can consider every sample mean as a data point and we can plot an histogram in the same way.</p>

            <div id='nl-block'>
                <div>
                    <p>If we plot all the sample means, we get a normal curve with most values in the center and few in the ends of the graph.</p>

            <section id="sampling">
                <p>For example, if we take 100 samples, we'll like to say that, at least 95% of them are going to be close to the population parameter. This is what is called the <b>confidence level</b>, which, in our case, we set to be 95%. This is determined by researchers depending on the level of accuracy they want to achieve.</p>
